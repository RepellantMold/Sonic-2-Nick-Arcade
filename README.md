# Sonic-2-Nick-Arcade
Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Nick Arcade is a special version of ''Sonic 2'' that was sent to the Nick Arcade show and was dumped by drx in 2006; being based on an extremely early build of the game means some weird stuff is hiding in the code. This disassembly is based on the one drx made back in 2006.

We do NOT take ownership of any of this code; all of it was programmed by Yuji Naka at Sega Technical Institute, 1992.
