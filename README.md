# Sonic 2 Nick Arcade Prototype - Split Disassembly
Sonic the Hedgehog 2: Nick Arcade is a prototype of Sonic 2 that was sent to the Nick Arcade show in (presumably early) 1992 and was dumped by drx in 2006.
Being an extremely early build of the game means weird stuff is hiding in the code, this disassembly is based on the one drx made back in 2006.

We do **NOT** take ownership of any of this code; all of it was programmed by Yuji Naka at Sega Technical Institute/STI, 1992.
